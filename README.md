# LIRI-Bot

## Description
LIRI-Bot is the language text version of Siri that can be used to search for concerts by the artist's name, movie information by the movie title and song information by the song title. To use the preceeding commands the user will either type "concert-this", "movie-this" or "spotify-this-song" before typing the name.

## Motivation
This tool was created as part of the University of Richmond Full Stack Flex Web Development program curriculum to further JavaScript and JSON package skills. It is useful for those who want to learn more about an artist's next concert, a movie or a song.

## Tech Used
- JavaScript
- JSON Packages (axios & spotify)
- Moment.js
This tool was created using a JavaScript file to pull information from the JSON packages/APIs and display it to the user.

## For Developers

*Remember to create your own ENV and keys files or the LIRI-Bot will not work.
